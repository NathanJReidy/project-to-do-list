# JavaScript To Do List Website

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

The to do list is a single page application created using ES6 modules, npm and Webpack. The website is a project-based to do list that lets you manage projects by creating, completing and deleting tasks.

The website uses the following third-party libraries to increase functionality:

- [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable): to let users reorganise tasks with drag and drop
- [Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment/): to give users relative dates for tasks (e.g. "due in 17 days")
